# Facebook style animation progress bar border in Vanilla Javascript, HTML and CSS


###### Whilst scrolling Facebook, I noticed a cool way to show the video progress bar, using border around the video.

In this tutorial, I've created a way to replicate this animation for fun. If you like it please use it!

This is a great way to practice your Javascript and CSS, as well as add some flavour to your hosted videos on your website.
